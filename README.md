# DIY Smart 18650 tester

#### Initial Idea:

I am trying to make smart 18650 tester/voltmeter so that I can quickly check my old salvaged batteries, using Arduino based microcontroller is easy as it is made for 5v input and output and I have to figure it out for ESP8266 based board, so that I can divide the voltage and then measure the voltage and capacity.

Using wifi based microcontroller gives access to smart monitoring and remote acess and more stuff like data logging!

# Initial Stage - V1.0
To submit as a class project for measurement and instrumentation subject intial stage is for manual working and showing data on an OLED display and also equiped with temperature sensor (Bosch-BMP280) to clearly see the temperature curve and cutoff at particular temperature

Idea is taken from instructables (https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Arduino-Battery-Capacity-Tester-V10-/)

### Hardware Requirements:

1. Arduino Nano

2. 0.96" OLED Display

3. MOSFET - IRLZ44

4. Resistors ( 4 x 10K , 1/4W )

5. Power Resistor ( 10R, 10W )

6. Screw Terminals

7. Prototype Board

8. 18650 Battery Holder

9. 18650 Battery

10. Hex Spacers

11. BMP280
